## 2.0.0

- New class `SheetMap` that allows you to store data as a map
- New class `SheetInteractionHandler` for more precise control of a sheet
- Renamed `Table` to `SheetColumn` as the old name wasn't as clear and also interfered with the Flutter widget `Table` causing import inconveniences
- Fixed `SheetColumn` encoding input data twice when writing to a sheet
- Changed package description (Previous one was incomplete)
- Added the ability to delete/clear cells


## 1.0.0

- Initial version.
